# NAME 

xindiserver âˆ’ wrapper for `indiserver`, integrating it into the MagAO-X ecosystem.

# SYNOPSIS 

```
xindiserver [options] 
```

`xindiserver` is normally configured with a configuration file, hence all command-line arguments are optional.

# DESCRIPTION 

`xindiserver` wraps the standard `indiserver` program in an MagAO-X interface.  This includes exposing configuration options, and capturing logs which are reformatted in the `flatlogs` binary logging system.

# DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS

Lists of driver names are passed to `xindiserver` via the configuration system.  Drivers can be either local or remote.

Driver names can not be repeated, whether local or remote.

## Local Drivers

Drivers running on the same machine are specified by their names only.  On the command line this would be
```
--local=driverX,driverY,driverZ
```
and in the configuration file this would be
```
[local]
drivers=driverX,driverY,driverZ
```

## Remote Drivers

Drivers running a remote machine are specified by their names and the name of the SSH tunnel to that machine.  `xindiserver` parses the `sshTunnels.conf` config file as part of configuration.  

NOTE: the tunnel specification is by the tunnel name (the section in the config file), not the host name.

On the command line this would be
```
--remote=driverR@tunnel_name_1,driverS@tunnel_name_2,driverT@tunnel_name_1
```
and in the configuration file this would be
```
[remote]
drivers=driverR@tunnel_name_1,driverS@tunnel_name_2,driverT@tunnel_name_1
```

In both cases it must be true that `sshTunnels.conf` contains a valid tunnel specification for `tunnel_name_1` and `tunnel_name_2`.

# EXIT STATUS

`xindiserver` runs until killed.
